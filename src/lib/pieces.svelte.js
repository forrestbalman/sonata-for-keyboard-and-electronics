	text: "Disclaimer, the identity of my upstairs neighbors remains anonymous for their and, arguably more important, my own protection. The sentiments are just as real, though. I now present to you, an open letter to my upstairs neighbors. Dear Upstairs Neighbors. Before I begin, I want to make it absolutely clear that I believe you are lovely people. Although we haven't had the opportunity to get to know each other, our few interactions in passing have been quaint, and I hope to have you both over for dinner sometime soon. This letter is about the noise. In the last year of living below you, I've gathered that you both are very productive people who like to keep busy at ALL HOURS of the day. I'd like to say that this is a commendable quality, but I'm afraid that the noise verges on the edge of commotion. Listen... I know that you both are renters, just like me, but one of the caveats of living in an apartment complex is thin walls. And even though it might feel like our everyday noises are suppressed because we don't get regular complaints, most of the time it's a matter of not wanting to be a bother. The rest of the time, it's me listening out of curiosity. For example, I could've sworn I've heard somebody practicing their bowling a few night ago, and all I could think to myself was, how on Earth could you possibly have enough space for a bowling alley in your apartment? I'm honestly more impressed than annoyed! But I digress. I spend a lot of time at home, and while that might not be of any concern to you, all I can do to advocate for more sound awareness on your part is to make you aware of all the noise, you're making on a daily basis. Of course, I understand that you both have lives to live, and I'm not asking you to stop living them, especially when they sound as exciting as they do. All I hope for is a little more consideration for me, and hopefully the rest of the building, when it comes to the noise. Thanks for taking the time to read this, and I hope it finds you well. Sincerely, Your Downstairs Neighbor.",
