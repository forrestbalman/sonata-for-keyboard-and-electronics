# Sonata for keyboard and electronics

# Overview
This is a piece generator for mechanical keyboard, electronics, and (optional) projection. I've graded this piece 5/5 accessible, meaning theres no prior music experience
needed in order to perform. You can learn more about accessibility grades here: 

The concept behind the piece is inspired by a few things:
-My curiosity surrounding the mechanical keyboard community and their fascination with sound, especially how timbres are classified: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjJT1Un2pIg.
-Typing tests and learn-to-type education as a primer for the notation.
-Looking at the keyboard as an "everyday instrument" that isn't contextualized musically in its regular use.

Performing this piece requires no prior experience.
Performance materials include:
- Mechanical keyboard
