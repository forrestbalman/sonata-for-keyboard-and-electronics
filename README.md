# Sonata for keyboard and electronics

Download or clone this repository to run your own local copy of the engine. This repository will stay updated with any of my compositions; however, you'll need your own copy to perform/edit/compose.

# Overview

This is a piece generator for mechanical keyboard, electronics, and (optional) projection. I've graded this piece 5/5 accessible, meaning theres no prior music experience
needed in order to perform. You can learn more about accessibility grades here:

The concept behind the piece is inspired by a few things:

-   My curiosity surrounding the mechanical keyboard community and their fascination with sound, especially how timbres are classified: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjJT1Un2pIg.
-   Typing tests and learn-to-type education as a primer for the notation.
-   Looking at the keyboard as an "everyday instrument" that isn't contextualized musically in its regular use.

Performing this piece requires no prior experience.
Performance materials include:

-   Mechanical keyboard
-   Microphone
-   Speakers
-   Screen/Projector

The user sits and "types" out the body of text following the on-screen prompt that progresses through the chosen body of text. As the user works their way through the prompt, your
provided sounds play.

# Running the engine

Make sure to have NodeJS and the Node Package Manager installed on the machine you plan to perform/compose on

1. Grab a copy of the engine by either downloading the code or cloning it to your machine
2. Open up the directory containing the engine in terminal of your choice
3. Type `npm i` to install all libraries
4. Type `npm run dev` to start the engine. If you have web development experience, you might look into creating a build of the engine, but because it's running locally, I didn't see a point in creating a build.
